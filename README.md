## How to fold a paper Aeroplane

1. Start with a piece of letter-sized paper (8.5 x 11 inches). Lay it flat on a clean, flat surface with the short edge facing you.
2. Fold the paper in half lengthwise by bringing the top edge down to align with the bottom edge. Ensure the edges are perfectly aligned, and crease the fold sharply.
3. Unfold the paper to its original position, with the sheet flat and the crease running vertically.
4. Take the top edges of the paper and fold them down diagonally so that they meet along the centre crease, forming a triangular shape at the top of the paper. Ensure both sides are symmetrical, and crease the folds.
5. Fold the paper in half again by folding it along the existing centre crease. The triangular flaps from step 4 should be on the outside.
6. Fold the two wings down by folding the top layer of paper to the bottom, aligning the edges with the centre crease. This creates the wings of your paper aeroplane.
7. Adjust the wings slightly to make sure they are level and symmetrical. This can affect how your paper aeroplane flies.
8. Ensure all creases are well-defined and smooth out any wrinkles. Your paper aeroplane is now ready to fly!
9. Hold the paper aeroplane by the bottom, just behind the wings. Stand in an open area and throw it gently, experimenting with different angles and amounts of force to see how it flies. You can make adjustments to the folds if needed for better performance.
